# 4-bit-ALU-using-VHDL

Project Overview:
The ALU performs fundamental arithmetic and logic operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, and NOT on 4-bit inputs.

Steps Involved:

Design and Coding: Developed the VHDL code to define the ALU operations.
Simulation: Verified the functionality using Vivadoâ€™s simulation tools.
Synthesis and Implementation: Implemented the design on an FPGA using Xilinx Vivado.
Verification on FPGA: Tested the ALU on an FPGA development board.
Key Learnings:

Gained hands-on experience with VHDL and FPGA design flow.
Enhanced understanding of digital logic circuits and hardware description languages.
